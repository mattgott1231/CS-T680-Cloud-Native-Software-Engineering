## API Design Part 2: Updates to Voter APIs
Proposed Changes to APIs:  In order to incorporate hypermedia to the voting API application, each main structure (Voter, Poll, and Votes) would be upgraded to include a “links” field that contain URI based targets for all of the next options the user can do with the application.  These links will be dynamically generated so that they are specific to the endpoint that they access.  For example on the Voter API, doing a GET for /voters/1 would return JSON structure that includes links for the available actions the user can take such as “GET All Voter Polls”:”/voters/1/polls”, “GET Voter Poll”:”/voters/1/polls/1”, or “POST add Voter Poll”:”/voters/1/polls/2”.  These will be dynamically updated based on the status/conditions of the searched voter and their vote history.  I also think it would be a good idea at the base /voters endpoint for there to be returned JSON for initial actions such as “GET Get All Voters”:”/voters”, “POST Add Voter”:”/voters/newID”, or “DELETE Delete all Voters”:”/voters” and options to access the /polls and /votes endpoints.  Those new endpoints would include hypermedia links for further action that will be designed in the final project, such as creating, updating, and deleting polls and vote histories.  The error-proofing logic would also need to be implemented to prevent recording a vote history without a valid voter or creating a vote without an existing poll.

This approach would better support the application from the user’s perspective by providing them the details on how to interact with the program without needing to know the inner workings of the API relationships and required data.  The other alternative would be to provide documentation describing the input requirements and endpoints for all of interactions to take place, and that can be messy and less automatic.  The HATEOAS approach allows the user/client to operate with little to no prior knowledge of the program.  For an example starting from the /voters endpoint, the user is provided with exact descriptions and links to perform a subsequent action.  They could search for all voters and find that none exist, and then have the link right in front of them to add a new voter.  If they then saw the link to add a vote for their new voter, they could go directly to that endpoint but only to find out that no polls exist yet.  Well, the hypermedia links the JSON response would again provide them directly how to generate the first poll.  This architecture will allow the user to bounce around and navigate between the three APIs without having the knowledge of the how the application was developed and structured.  It’s all provided in direct JSON response through links with descriptions.  That is the key concept behind hypermedia as the engine of application state.
